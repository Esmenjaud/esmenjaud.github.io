# The Map

After delving into what makes a robot portrait, this inquisitive extraterrestrial explorer, that's me, decided to delve into a dataset and craft a map of Earth. Leveraging insights from my alien cousin in the Star Wars galaxy, I speculated that the "Movie countries" in the movie dataset might correspond to places where humans dwell on our planet. In my cosmic imagination, Earth took the form of a whole planet without water (well I don't know what is water but my human writer of my story does), and I envisioned countries as points on its surface where human activity concentrated. I believed that by scrutinizing links between countries sharing movies, I could unveil connections. Simplifying the links to one dimension—represented by the number of shared movies—made the analysis more manageable. 

In my model, each graph edge symbolized this one-dimensional link between countries. Drawing on my knowledge of network data, I transformed the movie countries into an adjacency matrix, forming a graph where countries became nodes and shared movie links transformed into edges. Each link was weighted by the number of movies shared. Before sketching the graph, I pondered how to model the attraction between countries. My extraterrestrial mind toyed with the idea of paralleling it to gravity, envisioning a force that pulls two countries toward each other. Firstly, I decided to assess the importance of each node by creating its degree, unveiling the crucial nodes. Then, delving into more intricate measures, I explored Katz centrality and Eigenvector centrality. While both PageRank and Katz centrality are designed for directed graphs, my creation turned out to be undirected. With no other choice, I opted for Eigenvector centrality as a means to compute the importance of a node in the graph. A high eigenvector score, I realized, would indicate that a node is intricately linked to many others, each holding substantial importance themselves in the vast cosmic network I've constructed.

From my extraterrestrial perspective, the Earth map unfolds as a mesmerizing display, skillfully depicting the intricate connections that weave through the planet. As I observe, the countries appear closely situated, revealing noteworthy relationships among them with a deep core interconnection. The

To facilitate understanding, the map incorporates one circle just for the sake of visualization.

*A word from the narrator:*

*I am sorry to interrupt my story but this alien doesn't know that actually he is seeing in its deep core the G12 plus three countries. That's why I allowed myself to add a second circle to highlight the G12 countries. The G12 is an informal group of 12 countries that are the 12 largest economies of the world and this plot highlights that they influence in a way the world, a way part of the soft power.*

*That said Back to the story:*
