# What to say about human names?

The first part did the average outcome of a human robot portrait we can dress based on characterDF. But choosing trend in a movie could not reflect the reality of the human firstname repartition. The alien teacher notices to its student that he has a baby name dataset of the USA population over the years (#cliffhanger: the teacher knew everything!). From this second dataset, it will be possible to compare the firstnames repartition over the years and see if the movie dataset is representative of the reality. It could also help us to see if a firstname trend arrives in the movie dataset before the real life or the contrary.

For this purpose, we have to define the rules:
    - the study will be done on the USA population as the baby name dataset is only for this country
    - the study will be done on firstnames that are present in the movie dataset and the latter have a movie box office revenue
    - we will consider a valid firstname if the firstname is present IN the character name (it could be its firstname or its lastname or even its second, third, etc. firstname)

When we extract the firstname from the character name, we first led a simple comparison to know if some firstname are present before to be present in the baby name dataset. We found that 84 firstnames have a first apperance in a movie before being given to a baby.

Just by hovering with a mouse the above treemap, one can see the movie where the firstname appears for the first time as well as the first year where this firstname was given to a baby. Among the 84 firstnames, it is impossible to conclude that all of them were given to a baby DUE to the movie (e.g. despite Star Wars is an influent saga, one can not conclude that the firstname Emperor given for the firstname in 2008 is due to the Star Wars V released in 1980). However, it could be the case for others and it is interesting to see from which film the firstname comes from. 

Examples of three firstnames where the movie is more likely to have created the firstname and it was given to a baby after the movie release:
    - Bellatrix (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, 2007)
    - Neytiri (Avatar, 2009)
    - Samwise (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, 2001)
