# What to say about human names?

## Assumptions for the firstnames part

The first part presents the average outcome of a human-robot portrait that we can dress based on `characterDF`. However, choosing **trends** in a movie may not reflect the reality of the human firstname distribution. The alien teacher notices to its students that he has a baby name dataset of the USA population over the years (#cliffhanger: the teacher knew everything from the beginning but he hid it from his students!).

From this second dataset, it will be possible to compare the firstnames distribution over the years and see if the movie dataset is representative of reality. It could also help us see if a firstname trend arrives in the movie dataset before real life or vice versa.

For this purpose, we have to define the rules:
- The study will be done on the **USA population** as the baby name dataset is only for this country.
- The study will be done on firstnames that are present in the movie dataset, and the latter **has a movie box office revenue**.
- We will consider a **valid firstname** if the firstname is present IN the character name (it could be its firstname or its lastname or even its second, third, etc. firstname).

## Creation of new firstnames in birth register that come from top 100 movies

When we extract the firstname from the character name, we first conduct a simple comparison to know if some firstnames are present before being present in the baby name dataset. We found that **84 firstnames** have a first appearance in a movie before being given to a baby.

Just by hovering with a mouse over the above treemap, one can see the movie where the firstname appears for the first time as well as the first year when this firstname was given to a baby. Among the 84 firstnames, it is **impossible to conclude** that all of them were given to a baby *due to* the movie (e.g., despite Star Wars being an influential saga, one cannot conclude that the firstname Emperor given for the firstname in 2008 is due to *Star Wars V* released in 1980). However, it could be the case for others, and it is interesting to see from which film the firstname comes.

Examples of three firstnames where the movie is more likely to have created the firstname, and it was given to a baby after the movie release:
- Bellatrix (*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, 2007)
- Neytiri (*Avatar*, 2009)
- Samwise (*The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, 2001)

## Correlation of firstnames trends in movies and in birth register

Now armed with a dataset from their extraterrestrial professor, our alien student can eagerly explore Earth's firstnames trends in movies and in the **birth USA register**. He is interested in seeing if the trends are the same or not. This way, he could see if the firstname distribution in the movie dataset is representative of reality over the years.

After data exploration and correct work on the dataset, the alien was ready with his dataset. He filtered the dataset for firstnames that come from a movie that has a value in the movie box office revenue column and computed the **normalized frequency from both datasets**.

For the sake of clarity of what is now in his dataset before conducting a deeper analysis, the alien student decided to plot the **normalized** frequency of some arbitrarily chosen firstnames in movies and in the birth register. The line about the movies is **smoothed** by the **savgol filter**.

As the alien student can notice from this graph, some trends are sometimes different (in advance or in delay). So, he thinks that doing a **linear regression** won't help him to evaluate this delay; it could only assess the correlation between the two trends. He decides to do a **cross-correlation** analysis to see if there is a delay between the two trends. He computes the cross-correlation between the two trends for each firstname and plots the distribution of the delay. During the cross-correlation, the alien applied a **weight** based on the score of the movie (the higher the *movie box office revenue*, the higher the weight).

In simplifying the graph to highlight the top 200 first names for clarity, our diligent alien student discerns a notable feature. Comparing it to the previous graphs with the two curves, the alien observes that cross-correlation effectively pinpoints the time delay between the curves. This proves especially adept when both curves showcase a single peak. However, the alien notes a nuance in cases where the time delay is **highly negative**. In these instances, the time delay value lacks coherent interpretation because the two curves exhibit strictly opposing trends, making accurate peak comparison challenging.

As the plot is simplified with not all first names, the alien student decides to plot the time delay for all first names on a **dot plot** and on a log scale. This way, he can see the distribution of the time delay for all first names.

Carefully noting that a time delay of 0 is **predominant**, there's a suggestive indication that, in general, first names align with the trends observed in movie first names. This prompts a fascinating hypothesis: that people may name their babies influenced by the names they encounter in movies. However, it's crucial to approach this correlation **cautiously**. The lack of consideration for potential **confounders** in this interpretation demands prudence. Without accounting for various influencing factors, prematurely concluding a causal link between movie trends and baby names may lead to misconceptions. The alien student, maintaining a vigilant stance, refrains from definitive conclusions, recognizing the need for a **nuanced** understanding of Earth's naming patterns.

To enhance the alien investigation, he suggests to his alien teachers incorporating datasets on **potential confounders**, such as major events (e.g., Olympics, elections), celebrity influences, and local factors. However, disentangling these complex influences poses a significant challenge.
