# What to say about human names?

## Assumptions for the first names part

The first part presents the analysis made by R2D4 in which he established a human-robot portrait using the dataframe `characterDF`, the question we can ask ourselves now is what are the aliens looking at. What is the quality of the data, Is it a fair representation of human societies and more fundamentally, is the dataset of movies only a description of human society or rather something which also has the power to influence social trends? To perform this analysis we are going to look at human first name distribution and we are going to compare the name distribution in the CMU dataset and in the USA. 

From this second dataset, it will be possible to compare the first name distribution over the years and see if the movie dataset is representative of reality. It could also help us see if a first name trend arrives in the movie dataset before real life or vice versa.

For this purpose, we have to define the rules:
- The study will be done on the **USA population** as the baby name dataset is only for this country.
- The study will be done on first names that are present in the movie dataset **with a movie box office revenue**.
- We will consider a **valid first name** if the first name is present IN the character name (it could be its first name or its last name or even a middle name).

## Creation of new first names in birth register that come from the top 100 movies

When we extract the first name from the character name, we first conduct a simple comparison to know if some first names are present in movies before the baby name dataset. We found that **84 first names** have a first appearance in a movie before being given to a baby.

Just by hovering with a mouse over the above treemap, one can see the movie where the first name appears for the first time, as well as the first year when this first name was given to a baby. Among the 84 first names, it is **impossible to conclude** that all of them were given to a baby *due to* the movie (e.g., despite Star Wars being an influential saga, one cannot conclude that the name Emperor given in 2008 is due to *Star Wars V* released in 1980). However, it could be the case for others, and it is interesting to see from which film the name comes.

Examples of three first names where the movie is more likely to have created the first name which was given to a baby after the movie's release:
- Bellatrix (*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, 2007)
- Neytiri (*Avatar*, 2009)
- Samwise (*The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, 2001)

## Correlation of first name trends in movies and in birth registers

Now armed with a dataset from their extraterrestrial professor, our alien students can eagerly explore Earth's first name trends in movies and in the **USA birth register**. He is interested in seeing if the trends are the same or not. This way, he could see if the first name distribution in the movie dataset is representative of reality over the years.

After data exploration and correct work on the dataset, the alien was ready with his dataset. He filtered the dataset for first names that come from a movie that has a value in the movie box office revenue column and computed the **normalized frequency from both datasets**.

For the sake of clarity of what is now in his dataset before conducting a deeper analysis, the alien student decides to plot the **normalized** frequency of some arbitrarily chosen first names in movies and in the birth register. The line about the movies is **smoothed** by the **savgol filter**.

As the alien student can notice from this graph, some trends are sometimes different (in advance or delayed). Thus, he thinks that doing a **linear regression** won't help him to evaluate this delay; it could only assess the correlation between the two trends. He decides to do a **cross-correlation** analysis to see if there is a delay between the two trends. He computes the cross-correlation between the two trends for each first name and plots the distribution of the delay. During the cross-correlation, the alien applied a **weight** based on the score of the movie (the higher the *movie box office revenue*, the higher the weight).

In simplifying the graph to highlight the top 200 first names for clarity, our diligent alien student discerns a notable feature. Comparing it to the previous graphs with the two curves, the alien observes that cross-correlation effectively pinpoints the time delay between the curves. This proves especially adept when both curves showcase a single peak. However, the alien notes a nuance in cases where the time delay is **highly negative**. In these instances, the time delay value lacks coherent interpretation because the two curves exhibit strictly opposing trends, making accurate peak comparison challenging.

As the plot is not simplified with all first names, the alien student decides to plot the time delay for all first names on a **scatter plot** and on a log scale. This way, he can see the distribution of the time delay for all first names.

Carefully noting that a time delay of 0 is **predominant**, there's a suggestive indication that, in general, first names align with the trends observed in movie first names. This prompts a fascinating hypothesis: people may name their babies with the influence of the names they encounter in movies. However, it's crucial to approach this correlation **cautiously**. The lack of consideration for potential **confounders** in this interpretation demands prudence. Without accounting for various influencing factors, prematurely concluding a causal link between movie trends and baby names may lead to misconceptions. The alien student, maintaining a vigilant stance, refrains from definitive conclusions, recognizing the need for a **nuanced** understanding of Earth's naming patterns.

To enhance the alien investigation, he suggests to his alien teachers to incorporate datasets on **potential confounders**, such as major events (e.g., Olympics, elections), celebrity influences, and local factors. However, disentangling these complex influences poses a significant challenge.
