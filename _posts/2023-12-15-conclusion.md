# Conclusion

With our dataset, we have extracted the robot portrait of a human being in the years 2000's. Was this robot portrait representative of reality? Analysis on names, countries, and ethnicities or jobs helped us answer whether the cinema industry is close to reality. 
Eventually, as human beings, we reflect on which dataset we should agglomerate to send a broad and thorough view of society.


December 19, 2023, 11:23 AM: Voyager 1 has ceased responding. 

After 46 years of dedicated service, this spacecraft is now adrift in the vastness of space. As of today, it holds the distinction of being the farthest object ever crafted by human hands, positioned 2.436563e+10km away from Earth. Onboard, scientists have left a message intended for any extraterrestrial beings that may encounter itâ€”a gold-plated audio-visual disc known as the famous golden disk. This disc features a selection of symbols, images, and sounds designed to encapsulate and represent our world. 
The looming questions persist: Will these alien entities comprehend the message? Will they gain insight into our world and, by extension, into us as a species?
