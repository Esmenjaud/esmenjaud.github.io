# Conclusion

December 2023, 19th, 11:23 AM. Voyager 1 is not responding. After 46 years of loyal service, this probe is now lost in space. At this day, it is the furthest object ever created by humans. It is 2.436563e+10km away from Earth. On-board, scientist let a message for the aliens that will find it. This message is a gold-plated audio-visual disc. It contains few symbols, images and sounds that are supposed to represent our world named the famous golden disk. Will the aliens understand it? Will they be able to understand our world? Will they be able to understand us? That's a question we let other ADA students answer...
