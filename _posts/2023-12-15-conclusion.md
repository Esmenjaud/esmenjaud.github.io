# Conclusion
December 19, 2023, 11:23 AM: Voyager 1 has ceased responding. 

After 46 years of dedicated service, this spacecraft is now adrift in the vastness of space. As of today, it holds the distinction of being the farthest object ever crafted by human hands, positioned 2.436563e+10km away from Earth. Onboard, scientists have left a message intended for any extraterrestrial beings that may encounter itâ€”a gold-plated audio-visual disc known as the famous golden disk. This disc features a selection of symbols, images, and sounds designed to encapsulate and represent our world. 
The looming questions persist: Will these alien entities comprehend the message? Will they gain insight into our world and, by extension, into us as a species?

With our dataset, R2D4 the alien has extracted the portrait of an average inhabitant of planet Earth in the years 2000's using only the CMU movie dataset. This includes a physical description of humans and an analysis of their tastes. Was it representative of reality? That's what we tried to investigate by looking at the repetition of jobs and names in the dataset and in reality, it appears that the cinema industry is not exactly too close to reality. In order to avoid inducing aliens into errors (which is a very mean thing to do) we tried to extract a subset of representative movies which could be used by aliens to have a more realistic vision of humanity.
