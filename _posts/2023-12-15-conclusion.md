# Conclusion

December 19, 2023, 11:23 AM: Voyager 1 has ceased responding. 

After 46 years of dedicated service, this spacecraft is now adrift in the vastness of space. As of today, it holds the distinction of being the farthest object ever crafted by human hands, positioned 2.436563e+10km away from Earth. Onboard, scientists have left a message intended for any extraterrestrial beings that may encounter itâ€”a gold-plated audio-visual disc known as the famous golden disk. This disc features a selection of symbols, images, and sounds designed to encapsulate and represent our world. The looming questions persist: Will these alien entities comprehend the message? Will they gain insight into our world and, by extension, into us as a species? These are inquiries we leave for future ADA students to explore and answer.
