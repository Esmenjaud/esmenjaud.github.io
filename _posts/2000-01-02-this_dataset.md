# Contextualization

8000 years later and far away from our decaying home, the alien discoverers puzzled over the enigmatic treasure trove they had stumbled upon. Their advanced intellects delved into the intricacies of our stories, attempting to decipher the nuances of a civilization long gone. Through the lens of our cinematic legacy, **these alien archaeologists sought to unravel the mysteries of what is a human**. An alien student class decide to present their findings to their teacher about what they have learned from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus.

## The Dataset

The **CMU Movie Summary Corpus** comprises 42,306 movies and an accompanying dataset featuring information about characters. The initial dataset, centered on movie details, encapsulates the narratives of 81,741 films spanning the cinematic landscape from 1888 to 2012. Complementing this, the second dataset delves into the intricacies of 450,669 characters. In their inaugural endeavor, the extraterrestrial scholars are poised to navigate through the character dataset, aiming to distill insights that will pave the way for crafting a humanoid robotic portrayal based on their preliminary analyses of these character details.
