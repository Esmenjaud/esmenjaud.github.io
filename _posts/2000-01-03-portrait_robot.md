# What does the typical human look like?


## Basic despritions

### Gender
HI THERE! I'm Nono, an inhabitant from the planet Xuluberlu. With my team, we are studying an archaic and extremely old civilization called "humanity". 

Do you know what a typical human looks like? 
Let's take a look at these two simple graphs.

<!-- include the first plot -->
<!-- <iframe src="img/html/jean_.html" width="1000" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px"></iframe> -->

<div style="display: flex;">

  <div style="width: 50%; padding-right: 10px;">
    <!-- Content of the left graph -->
    <iframe src="img/html/jean_character_gender.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>

  <div style="width: 50%; padding-left: 10px;">
    <!-- Content of the right graph -->
    <iframe src="img/html/jean_evolution_gender_distribution.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>

</div>

Humanity clearly has two genders, but the repartition is quite unfair between both. Ratio between both is moving with time, but we should be able to say there is around 2 times more males than females on this civilization. Maybe a biais from their genetic conception?
