# What does the typical human look like?


## Basic physical descritions

### Gender
HELLO THERE! I'm R2D4, an inhabitant from the planet Xuluberlu. With my team, we are studying an archaic and extremely old civilization called "humanity". 

Do you know what a typical human looks like? 
Let's take a look at these two simple graphs.

<!-- include the first plot -->
<!-- <iframe src="img/html/jean_.html" width="1000" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px"></iframe> -->

<div style="display: flex;">

  <div style="width: 50%; padding-right: 10px;">
    <!-- Content of the left graph -->
    <iframe src="img/html/jean_character_gender.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>

  <div style="width: 50%; padding-left: 10px;">
    <!-- Content of the right graph -->
    <iframe src="img/html/jean_evolution_gender_distribution.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>

Humanity clearly has two genders, but the repartition is quite unfair between both. Ratio between both is moving with time, but we should be able to say there is around 2 times more males than females on this civilization. Maybe a biais from their genetic conception?


### Age
(Hugo let's go)


### Heigth
Come closer, reader! This is a representation of their heights. They are not really tall as you can see (to give you an idea, one meter corresponds to a quarter of our medium size).

Again, there is a noticable difference between man and women here. (perform a t-test to show it??????)




### Ethnicity

## How do they work?

### Military ranks

Some charactors names are given us precious information about human occupations, especially using their denomination. Let's focus on the charactor names which begins by a military rank (around three percent of them! (2.7%)).

*Note to the human reader: three percent of military personnel is a lot, comparatively to [World Bank data on December 2023](https://tradingeconomics.com/world/armed-forces-personnel-total-wb-data.html), for which less than 0.5% of the total world population (around 30 million people) are military personnel.*

We get the following graph.

Since we know the most graded personnel is also the most rare one, I guess the previous graph gives us a good approximation of the herarchy of ranks in the army: a "Captain" is, therefore, less graded than a "Private".

*Note to the human reader: poor R2D4! He couldn't know he is suffering a terrible cofactor here: the interest of a given military rank for movies scenarists. Indeed, it is more likely to see a Captain than a Private on the silver screen, not because there is less Privates than Captains, but because a Captain has so much responsabilities than a Private, and therefore is more interesting for scenarist.*


### Doctor positions
I was reading our data, when I noticed a singular fact. Lots of characters are called 'Dr.'.

Whoooah, such a miss! A t-test (p-value < 1e-59) discredites the null-hypothesis "There are as many female doctors as female actors in general". 

*Note to the human reader: the biais in women representation in movie is a [well-known gender effect](http://eijh.modares.ac.ir/article-27-30885-en.html)...*
