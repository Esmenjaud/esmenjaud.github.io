# What does the typical human look like?

HI THERE! I'm Nono, an inhabitant from the planet Xuluberlu. With my team, we are studying an archaic and extremely old civilization called "humanity". 

Do you know what a typical human looks like? 
Let's take a look at these two simple graphs.

<!-- include the first plot -->
<!-- <iframe src="img/html/jean_.html" width="1000" height="600" frameborder="0" style="border: 0px"></iframe> -->

<div style="display: flex;">

  <div style="width: 50%; padding-right: 10px;">
    <!-- Content of the left graph -->
    <iframe src="img/html/jean_character_gender.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>

  <div style="width: 50%; padding-left: 10px;">
    <!-- Content of the right graph -->
    <iframe src="img/html/jean_evolution_gender_distribution.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>

</div>

Humanity clearly has two genders, but the repartition is quite unfair between both.
